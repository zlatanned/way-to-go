# Arrays, Range, Map

  ## Arrays
    => An array is a sequence of elements of the same type.
    => An array is defined using square brackets which define the number of elements the array will hold.

    For example:
        var a [5] int
        Now a is an array of 5 integers.

    You can also define and initialize values of the array using the following syntax:
      a := [5]int{0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
    Note: As you can see, we need to provide the size of the array when declaring it. This means that arrays have a fixed size.
