/*
EXPLANATION :::
  a => is a Pointer Receiver like this.. func (t *Type) Method() {} //pointer receiver 
  But b => is a Value Receiver like this.. func (t Type) Method() {} //value receiver

  If you want to change the state of the receiver in a method, manipulating the value of it, use a pointer receiver.
  Itâ€™s not possible with a value receiver, which copies by value.
  Any modification to a value receiver is local to that copy.
