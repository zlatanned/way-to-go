#GETTING STARTED

##Packages

    Every Go program is made up of packages.

    A Go program starts running in the main package.

    This is why we need to declare our code as the main package


##Imports

    Apart from main, Go has many packages that can be imported and used in the code to accomplish different tasks.

    One of the most popular packages is "fmt", which stands for format, and provides input and output functionality.

    To import a package, we use the import statement:
        
        For single import: import "fmt" 
        For single or multiple : import ( "fmt" "shahi" "zlatan")
