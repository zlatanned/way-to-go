## Variables

    => Variables are used to store values.
    In Go, the var keyword is used to declare variables.
    For example:
        var i int

    The code above declares a variable named i of type int.
    int stands for integer and represents whole numbers.
    
    =>Variable Initialization Methods:
            Way 1 -> var i, j int = 8, 42
            Way 2 -> var i, j = 8, 42
            Way 3 -> i := 8 (Go supports short variable declaration using :=)
            Way 4 -> x, y := 10, 5
